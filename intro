Structure of a Computer System
 A Computer System consists of:
   Users (people who are using the computer)
   Application Programs (Compilers, Databases, Games, Video player, Browsers, etc.)
   System Programs (Shells, Editors, Compilers, etc.)
   Operating System ( A special program which acts as an interface between user and hardware )
Hardware ( CPU, Disks, Memory, etc)

DEF:
   It provides interaction between users of computers and computer hardware.
   interface between user & hardware.(link user and hardware)
   it is a system software.
    controls the execution of application programs
    operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer
    
     storage management
    security & protection ---if we want to open phone we want to enter password and check and authorize password are stored in os

 GOALS:
     1)Efficiency
     2)convenience
TYPES:
        batch os
        multiprogramming os
        multi tasking os
        multi processing os
        real time os
Batch os: Sequence of jobs in a program on a computer without manual interventions.(job-----> program +input+control instruction ........user cant intract with that os..........)
           similar types of jobs were batched together and executed in time.
    

HARDWARE consists :
       memory, CPU, ALU, I/O devices, peripheral devices, and storage devices
   
   Assembly language: user doesnot understand the user language so user start to learn machine understandable language this is called assembly level language.
  
    shell programming  - intract between the user and os
    kernal programming -intract between os and hardware
     
    compiler/interpreter  --convert human language  to computer understandable language
    compiler  -check line by line code error and execution
    interpretor - check entire program and indicate error at a shot execute a whole
